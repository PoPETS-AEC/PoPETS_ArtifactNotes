#Starting a new year for artifact review

Each August, just as PoPETs starts a new review cycle, we also start a new review cycle for artifact review. There are a few things that need to be done to set things up.

## Creating a new HotCRP instance

You'll need to email the PoPETs HotCRP admin to create a new instance. The URL for the artifact submission site has been https://submit.petsymposium.org/artifactYYYY where YYYY is the 4 digits of the upcoming year. As an example, in August of 2021 we are now setting up the instance for the 2022 submission year and so the submission site is https://submit.petsymposium.org/artifact2022.

The current HotCRP admin is Ian Goldberg. For up to date information, check for the "Infrastructure Chairs" on this year's CFP.

## Configuring the HotCRP instance

There is not much configuration necessary to accept submissions. Make sure you open submissions for the first round and set the submission deadline if desired. In the settings menu, select the "Submission Form" setting. Make sure both an abstract and PDF are required. Add a new submission field titled "Artifact link and brief description" of type "multiline text". Set the topics so reviewers can indicate preferences. So far we've used "source code", "data sets", and "other" but feel free to experiment :)

We recently added an indicator for specialized hardware, this helps for identifying artifacts that we may need to reach out to external reviewers for. 

Make sure you select "Save changes" before leaving the screen.

You will also want to ensure the review form has been configured to the preferred information. (e.g. artifact readiness, artifact award worthiness)

## Inviting artifact committee members

We need to make sure the artifact committee PC is ready to go by the first round deadline. I usually send an invitation email with some stats from the previous year and some changes for the upcoming year. This email is sent to the existing artifact committee as well as any new potential committee members. There is an option to sign up or nominate people to be on the artifact committee in the "Reviewer Nomination Form". If you have not gotten the list of artifact reviewers from the current chairs, you can try reaching out to them. We've gotten a large list of reviewers this way.

Once an artifact reviewer has replied to the invitation email, add them to the HotCRP instance.

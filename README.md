# PoPETS_ArtifactNotes

TODO List: 
- send out review reminders, author reminders, ...
- update committee on website
- turn readme into a table of contents/guide to access other information in the repo as it expands. e.g. there could be a for authros, for reviwers, for chair breakdown
- Make new reviewer doc. Include: typical timelines, reviewing advice, FAQ 
- create list of questions as they come up to eventually generate faq for reviewers and authors of artifacts
- artifact award creation/design in preparation for proposal to committee 


# General Notes in Progress
After a paper has been accepted to an issue of PoPets the list of accepted papers is sent to the aritfact chairs by the current program chairs. This list will be used to generate the HotCRP accounts and send out an invitation to submit an artifact to all authors. 







# Notice to Authors Timeline
The invitation should include: 
- timeline estimates for authors 
- explanation of the process
- link to call for artifact page with information on what is an artifact
- contact info for chairs


Authors are invited to submit an artefact aproximately x time intervals after their paper has been accepted. They will have an interval of y time to prepare their artefact and submit it. After submission reviews will be received (ideally) after z weeks. This normally corresponds to the camera ready paper deadline. The authors will then receive an email informing them there are reviews available and they can begin responding to the reviews to improve their artefact and move it towards submission. This iterative process will continue for the specified time duration and then a decision will be reached. After a decision has been reached there is no further action required on the part of the authors. 


# Notice to Reviewers Timeline



# Sending out Mail via HoTCRP
Currently use one isntance for all issues. Be very careful to select the correct ones. 
For example: sent to all authors without decision versus send to all authors. 
It's difficult to filter authors so either do it by hand or you can also select for authors with unresolved submissions or something like that.

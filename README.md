# PoPETS_ArtifactNotes

TODO List: 
- turn readme into a table of contents/guide to access other information in the repo as it expands. e.g. there could be a for authros, for reviwers, for chair breakdown
- Make new reviewer doc. Include: typical timelines, reviewing advice, FAQ 
- create list of questions as they come up to eventually generate faq for reviewers and authors of artifacts
- artifact award creation/design in preparation for proposal to committee 



# Notice to Authors Timeline


# Notice to Reviewers Timeline



# Sending out Mail via HoTCRP
Currently use one isntance for all issues. Be very careful to select the correct ones. 
For example: sent to all authors without decision versus send to all authors. 
It's difficult to filter authors so either do it by hand or you can also select for authors with unresolved submissions or something like that.

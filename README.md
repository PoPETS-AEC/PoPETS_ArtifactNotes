# PoPETS Artifact Evaluation

This repository serves as the common knowledge basis for the Artifact Evaluation
Co-Chairs of the annual Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS).

The objective is to describe the involved processes, gather resources (email
templates, documentations, etc.), and keep a record of the statistics of each
edition, so that it can be passed on more easily over the years.

We try to keep everything as transparent as possible. If you have any questions
feel free to contact us.

Note that we also contribute resources and results to [the secartifacts
website](https://secartifacts.github.io/) as well.

Subject:  Instructions and bidding for the first round of artifact review

Welcome to the PoPETs <YEAR> artifact committee! The first round of
submissions are in and there are <NUMBER> submissions.  With <NUMBER> committee
members we expect each member will be assigned <NUMBERS> reviews this round.
If you have not already indicated your conflicts, please do so.

Further, please verify that your affiliation information is correct in
HotCRP and on the Pets webpage. Let us know if there are any errors.

This year we are trying something new and have opened up bidding for
committee members to indicate preferences on which artifacts they would
like to review.

Specific instructions for bids:
-------------------------------

Site URL: <ADD URL>

**Enter bids, but sort by relevance**:
- Go to the "Review Preferences" page:
  https://submit.petsymposium.org/artifact2023/reviewprefs.php

- Enter one of the following values as a bid (itâ€™s useful for the
chairs
when bids have clear semantics):
   3     I want to review this artifact
   2     It's a good artifact for me
   1     It's an ok artifact for me
   0     Doesn't seem right for me (default)
   -1    I really shouldn't be reviewing this
   -100  Conflict

- Please try to enter a +2/+3 bid for at least 2 artifacts for which you
think you are well qualified. Note that you do not need to do a detailed
review of any source code, we are mostly checking to make sure the
artifacts compile, run, and have easy to follow setup instructions. See
our review guidelines for more information:
https://petsymposium.org/artifacts.php

This bidding process worked well last year, but we cannot guarantee you
your preferences. However, we hope this continues to benefit reviewers
and authors. Please do not feel you need to spend time selecting your
artifacts. But if something particularly interests you or if you think
something is too far outside your expertise, this is your chance to
indicate it.

The deadline for preferences is <DEADLINE>, after this we
will be assigning reviews.

Please don't hesitate to contact us with any questions or concerns at
any stage of this process!

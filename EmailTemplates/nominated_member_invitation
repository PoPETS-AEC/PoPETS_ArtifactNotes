-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We invite you to be part of the PoPETs artifact evaluation committee for the upcoming year 2025.

Last year there were a total of 69 artifacts submitted, with  â‰¤3 reviews per
committee member, and with ~1 assigned review per committee member in each
round.

As last year, there are four rounds for PoPETS 2025.
For each round, the bidding period for artifacts starts ~3 weeks after the
author notification date, which can be found
[here](https://petsymposium.org/cfp25.php). The review period will then start
approximately one week after that and will last for three weeks. The current
details of the review process can be found [here] (https://petsymposium.org/artifacts.php). Note that we will improve the page according to the feedback from PoPETS 2024 within the next days. In particular, we will detail the requirements of the individual badges and maybe add a third badge. If you have more suggestions for smoothing the process and reducing the workload of the reviewers further, let us know at artifact25@petsymposium.org.
In case of questions feel free to reach out to us at any time.

Please reply to this email to let us if you're willing to serve on the artifact
evaluation committee for PETS25. Please provide your first and last names and your affiliation as it should appear on the PETS web page. If you don't want to serve, a simple 'no' is also helpful for our planning.

Thank you for your time, 

Miti and Max

We are in the process of inviting the artifact review committee for
PETS 2024. Do you know someone who would be great to join the PETS
artifact committee for the current submission cycle (2024 year)?

For PETS 2023, there were a total of 61 submitted artifacts and an average of 3 reviews per committee member, with a maximum of 2 assigned reviews per committee member each round.

The deadlines and review periods for the upcoming year are similar to
last year's, and we expect the review load to remain the same (or lower).
In each round, authors will submit artifacts approximately three weeks after the notice of acceptance. The initial review period takes place for the following three weeks after that.

Most artifacts are source code. So, the reviewer's role often consists of
accessing the code repository, attempting to execute the code base following
the documentation, and verify if it corresponds to the paper (reviewing
the documentation). In most cases, this should take little time. If, however, the reviewer runs into issues; they spend a short time attempting to fix the artifacts
However, if the artifacts have multiple issues, they document them, describe their progress and what they tried to get them running. 
And then post it back for the authors, who attempt to address the problems. The authors then fix the documentation and the code so the reviewer can try again. So unlike a paper,  initial
artifact review is shorter (in terms of time), but then there are
multiple short bursts of time needed to finish the iterative process. If
an artifact is going on too long (or other exception), sometimes the
chairs take over to complete shepherding it towards acceptance.

Please let us know by **July 28th** if you or someone else is willing
to serve on the artifact committee. If you've been on vacation and got this email after that date, please feel free to reach out if you are
willing to be on the committee. We'll see if it will work.

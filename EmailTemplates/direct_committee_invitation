Thank you for all your hard work on the PoPETs 2022 artifact committee. In
the third year of this process, there were 51 total artifacts submitted,
and an average of 6 reviews per committee member, with a maximum of 3
assigned reviews per committee member each round.

We're wrapping up the last five artifacts from the final round, and overall
the quality of accepted artifacts continues to improve. Thank you for your
hard work, and we're hoping you'll join us in doing this again next year.
The deadlines and review periods for the upcoming year are similar to last
year's and we expect the review load to remain the same (or lower).

2023.1 artifact reviewing period:
<Month day> for three weeks

2023.2 artifact reviewing period:

2023.3 artifact reviewing period:

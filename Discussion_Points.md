# Discussion Points (PETS 2023)

- Should we provide some common environment for the authors & reviewers to use?
  - What should be the spec?
  - Who should own and/or maintain this?

- Should we create multiple instances of HotCRP? This might help for "overlapping" issues when an artifact from previous issue is not yet accepted but we need to start the process for the next round already. Also, this is the same as how PETS operate.

  - Decision: Yes, we will be using multiple instances for 2024.

- Should we have a hard deadline for the artifact to be accepted? Currently, some papers take months to be accepted.

- Should we add a suggested deadline for *the reviewer* to response to comments on "PoPETs Artifact Review" page on PETS website?

- Should we increase the number of reviewers per artifacts to 3 instead of 2? This will help reduce the number of emergency reviewers required and reduce delay too.

- Related to above, should we increase the PC size? (Currently, most PC members review 3-4 artifacts.)

- Should we make the outcome of artifacts review more fine-grained? For example, ACM has [a guideline](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current) for artifact badges that include "Artifacts Available" and "Results Reproduced" among others.

- Do we want artifact appendices like USENIX does (note this will be tricky unless much stronger deadlines are enforced)?

- Add additional documentation for website on what is expected from authors

- Add additional "what makes a good review" to artifact review committee.

# Discussion Points (PETS 2023)

- Should we provide some common environment for the authors & reviewers to use?
  - What should be the spec?
  - Who should own and/or maintain this?

- Should we create multiple instances of HotCRP? This might help for "overlapping" issues when an artifact from previous issue is not yet accepted but we need to start the process for the next round already. Also, this is the same as how PETS operate.

- Should we have a hard deadline for the artifact to be accepted? Currently, some papers take months to be accepted.

- Should we add a suggested deadline for *the reviewer* to response to comments on "PoPETs Artifact Review" page on PETS website?

- Should we increase the number of reviewers per artifacts to 3 instead of 2? This will help reduce the number of emergency reviewers required and reduce delay too.

- Related to above, should we increase the PC size? (Currently, most PC members review 3-4 artifacts.)

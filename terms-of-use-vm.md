## Notes
#### Document what is logged:
- Who started/deleted what type of machine when
- Which mac/ipv4/ipv6 addr a users' VM had
- Standard weblogs for hotcrp+what hotcrp logs

#### Acceptable use/abuse policy:
- Only use infrastructure for artifact evaluation
- No private use (entailed by the former, but good to make explicit as well)
- Do not try to break/exploit the infrastructure; If you manage to find a vuln, report and do not snoop in other people's data; Ideally send patches.
- Do not engage in abuse against the Internet apart from active measurements that are being reproduced
- Do not do measurements from non-scan VMs
- Turn of and delete VMs you no longer need
- All VMs are wiped 1 week after an artifact has been accepted/rejected.
- Perform basic hygiene for the machines you allocated, i.e., do not set weak passwords and ideally use SSH key authentication
- Abuse leads to a loss of the VM privilege.

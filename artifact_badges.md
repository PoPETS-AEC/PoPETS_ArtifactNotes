# Artifact Badges

For PETS 2024, each accepted artifact will be granted one of the following two badges. The authors must select which badge they would like to be evaluated for during the submission process.

## Artifacts Available

This indicates that the artifact is publicly available at a permanent location with a clear documentation on how it is related to the corresponding paper and, if applicable, how to run the artifact. This badge does *not* guarantee that the results have been reproduced by the reviewers.

Authors whose artifacts require extremely specialized hardware or software are encouraged to choose this option. Similarly, authors whose artifacts are "not reproducible" (e.g. outcomes of surveys) should also choose this option.

## Artifacts Reproduced

This indicates that the submitted artifacts can be used to reproduce the main findings of the paper. Note that this does not necessarily cover all experiments / data presented in the paper. To submit artifacts for this badge, the authors must clearly specify the commands to run the artifacts in order to reproduce each main finding.

Even if the authors choose this option, the review committee may request to only grant an "available" badge, in the event that the reviewers are unable to reproduce the results (e.g. lack of computational resources).

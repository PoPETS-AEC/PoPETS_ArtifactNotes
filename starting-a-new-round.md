#Starting a new round of artifact reviews

A new round of artifact review begins when the PoPETs chairs email you a list of accepted papers for that round of the journal. This list will be a .csv file with the paper titles, names, and email addresses of paper authors.

## Create the new round in HotCRP

While logged in to HotCRP as an administrator, open the settings for the instance.

1. Within settings, go to the `Submissions` tab and make sure the `Open site for submissions` option is checked.

2. Set the `Submission Deadline` field to the artifact submission deadline. We typically set this to same as the camera ready deadline, which you can find out from the chairs or the Call For Papers on the [PoPETs site](https://petsymposium.org). If this is not the first round, this deadline will already be set for the previous round. Just replace the old deadline with the new one. Make sure the deadline is time-zone aware (don't close it too early for those in a later time zone).

   Example: if the camera ready deadline is June 15 2021, set the artifact submission deadline to `16 June 2021 7:59:59am EDT`

3. Set the Grace Period to something like 24 or 48 hours. We don't care too much about punctuality here.

4. Select `Allow updates until the submission deadline (usually the best choice)`
5. Set the reviewer visibility to anonymous

6. Save the changes

## Email the authors with instructions for how to submit their artifact

Instead of creating accounts for all authors, we've found it easiest to just email them directly with information on how to make their own account on the artifact submission site. You can see a template email in [artifact-submission-email-template.txt](artifact-submission-email-template.txt).

I usually send the emails in batches with about 30 email addresses in the BCC. Most email providers will complain if the number of addresses in the BCC field is too many. Also make sure the CC the `artifact-pets@petsymposium.org <artifact-pets@petsymposium.org>` account.

## Wait for artifacts to be submitted and answer questions

Often there will authors with questions about the artifact process. If the questions are frequent, consider adding them to the [artifact guidelines](https://petsymposium.org/artifacts.php).

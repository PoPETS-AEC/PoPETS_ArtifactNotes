# What Makes a Good Review

The goal of artifact review is to help ensure the artifacts are as useful as possible. Towards this goal, the review should check for the following points.
- Is the artifact publicly available at a permanent location?
- Documentations:
  - Is the relationship between the artifact and the paper clear?
  - If applicable, is the requirement for running the artifact clear?
  - If applicable, are the instructions to run the artifact sufficient?
  - If applicable, are the required dataset & packages publicly available?
- Reproducibility: In case that the authors choose "artifact reproduced" badge option, the reviewers should also check that the experiments run and the results displayed are similar to the ones in the paper.

Artifact review process is interactive and we expect the authors to take into account the reviewers' comments and modify their artifacts accordingly. As such, the reviews should contain sufficient details for the authors to make the appropriate changes; for example, if the code fails, then the review should include the environment that it is run on and the error messages. After the authors have fixed the issues, they will add a comment on the submission site, at which point the reviewers can either approve the artifact or provide additional comments for another rounds of revision.

# Artifact Award

ToDos: 
- consensus on spelling `artefact` versus `artifact`
- add HotCRP setting to include 'award worthiness'
- propose to PETS 

-------------------------------------------------------------

## Award
Award will consist of highlight on the PETs website (similar to other awards) acknowledging the artifacts excellence. 

### Award Rules/Eligibility
Artifact submitted and accepted for a paper published in the current PoPETS publication year in any of the four submission cycles. Award worthiness is based on initial submission (not the changes that lead to accept back and forth with reviewers). This encourages a strong initial submission and rewards authors for their efforts.

### Award decisions
Artifact committee members during reviews can check a box in HotCRP to indicate that an artifact should be considered for the award. 
A committee of 2-3 members of the artifact committee (including chairs) will evaluate nominated artifacts according to the following principles: 
 
**a) Reproducibility** - does it do what it says it does/relationship to its paper and for the broader research community.

**b) Usability/Accessibility** - inclusion of potential difficulties and how to address them, adaptations for large hardware/resource demands if applicable,...

**c) Readability** - easy to follow flow/process for achieving the usable/reproducible/accessible via the documentation.

Step 9: Artifact Submission

Authors of accepted papers will receive an invitation to submit a corresponding
artifact. The deadline for artifact submission is about 10 days after the paper
revision deadline. The evaluation process is designed to be interactive between
reviewers and authors to improve the artifacts (if needed). As such, reviewers
are expected to release a preliminary artifact review and start discussions with
authors by about 3 weeks after submission at the latest. Similarly, authors are
expected to respond to reviewers and make preliminary updates to their artifact
(if any needed) about 4 weeks after submission. This interactive process
continues until the finalized deadline which is about 7 weeks after submission.

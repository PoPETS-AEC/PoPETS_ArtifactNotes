# Diverse lessons learned while going through the process for 2026

## Finalizing PETS 2025 Artifacts

- Double check that updates (for badges, links, etc.) have been sent to
  publicity chairs and appear on the website.

- Introduce a (firm) finalized deadline to ensure interactivity from everyone.
  This should be before the conference for the last issue (i.e., aim to finalize
  evaluations by the conference date).

- Still assign at least 2 reviewers for "Available" badge artifacts in case
  someone has some issues.

- Ask author submitting artifact to list all authors names and affiliation from
  paper (for conflicts)

Subject: Invitation to submit artifact for %TITLEHINT%

Dear author(s),

Hello and congratulations on your accepted PoPETs 2026 paper!

%TITLE% %URL%/paper/%NUMBER%

PoPETs reviews and publishes digital artifacts related to its accepted papers.
This process aids in the reproducibility of results and allows others to build
on the work described in the paper. Artifact submissions are requested from
authors of all accepted papers, and although they are optional, we strongly
encourage you to submit your artifacts for review.

Artifacts can include source code for proofs of concept, measurements, user
studies, course repositories, simulations, datasets, and build environments.
Anything you can think of that would help other researchers and developers of
privacy enhancing technologies reproduce, build upon, or deploy your research is
encouraged.

For a detailed list of artifact submission guidelines and resources, please see
the artifacts page on the PoPETs website:
https://petsymposium.org/artifacts.php. Note that the ARTIFACT_EVALUATION.md
file has been renamed to ARTIFACT-APPENDIX.md and has been modified. Ensure that
you use the latest version of the file, as described on the artifacts page
linked above.

You can also see submitted artifacts from the 2025 edition of PoPETs linked
along with the papers on the program https://petsymposium.org/2025/program.php
and proceedings website: https://petsymposium.org/popets/2025/

The deadline for artifact submissions for PETS 2026 issue 1 is:

- Artifact Finalized Deadline (firm): Friday, Oct 31, 2025

Note that the artifact review process is meant to be interactive between authors
and reviewers in order to fix potential issues that are uncovered during the
evaluation. To ensure this interactivity, within the deadlines, we have encoded
a date by which reviewers will be asked to submit a preliminary review, as well
as date by which the authors will be expected to have responded and made
preliminary updates. Thus, please actively respond to reviewers' comments and
make modifications (if needed), so that your artifact can be awarded badge(s) by
the Artifact Finalized Deadline.

Please let us know at <artifact26@petsymposium.org> if you have any concerns
with meeting these deadlines, would like to submit to a later artifact issue,
or, have any questions regarding the process.

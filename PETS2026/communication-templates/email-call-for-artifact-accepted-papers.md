Subject: Invitation to submit artifact for %TITLEHINT%

Dear author(s),

Hello and congratulations on your accepted PoPETs 2026 paper!

%TITLE%
%URL%/paper/%NUMBER%

PoPETs reviews and publishes digital artifacts related to its accepted papers. This process aids in the reproducibility of results and allows others to build on the work described in the paper. Artifact submissions are requested from authors of all accepted papers, and although they are optional, we strongly encourage you to submit your artifacts for review.

Artifacts can include source code for proofs of concept, measurements, simulations, datasets, and build environments. Anything you can think of that would help other researchers and developers of privacy enhancing technologies reproduce, build upon, or deploy your research is encouraged.

For a detailed list of artifact submission guidelines and resources, please see
the artifacts page on the PoPETs website: https://petsymposium.org/artifacts.php

You can also see submitted artifacts from the 2025 edition of PoPETs linked
along with the papers on the website: https://petsymposium.org/2025/program.php

The deadline for artifact submissions for PETS 2026 issue 1 is:

  **Wednesday, Sep 10, 2025 at 23:59 AoE**.

To submit your artifact, create an account on our artifact submission
site for 2026.1:
  > https://artifact.petsymposium.org/artifact2026.1/

The next deadlines are:

- Artifact Submission Deadline: Wednesday, Sep 10, 2025
- Evaluation and Interactive Discussion Start: Wednesday, Sep 17, 2025
- Preliminary Artifact Review Deadline: Wednesday, Oct 1, 2025
- Preliminary Artifact Updates Deadline: Wednesday, Oct 8, 2025
- Evaluation and Interactive Discussion continue until decision is reached
- Artifact Finalized Deadline (firm): Friday, Oct 31, 2025

Note that the artifact review process is meant to be interactive between authors
and reviewers in order to fix potential issues that are uncovered with the
artifact. To ensure this interactivity, we encoded in the deadlines dates by
which reviewers will be asked to submit a preliminary review and authors will be
expected to have responded and made preliminary updates. That being said, please
actively respond to reviewers' comments and make modifications (if needed), so
that your artifact can be awarded badge(s) by the Artifact Finalized Deadline.

Please let us know at <artifact26@petsymposium.org> if you have any concerns with meeting these deadlines and would like to submit to a later deadline, or, have any questions regarding the process.

Subject: Finalized deadline for badge decision this Friday, May 1, 2026

---

Dear author(s),

Just a reminder that the finalized deadline for badges decision for PoPETs 2026.3 artifacts is less than a week away (Friday, May 1, 2026).

If your artifact needs further updates to obtain the corresponding badges, please do them soon to let enough time to reviewers to evaluate these edits. Also, please keep interacting with reviewers to help things move along.

Feel free to also post a comment to reviewers or us, chairs, if more clarifications are needed or if you have a question about anything.


Thanks in advance for your reactivity in this final stage!

PoPETs reviews and publishes digital artifacts related to its accepted papers.
This process aids in the reproducibility of results and allows others to build
on the work described in the paper. Artifact submissions are requested from
authors of all accepted papers, and although they are optional, we strongly
encourage you to submit your artifacts for review.

Artifacts can include source code for proofs of concept, measurements, user
studies, course repositories, simulations, datasets, and build environments.
Anything you can think of that would help other researchers and developers of
privacy enhancing technologies reproduce, build upon, or deploy your research is
encouraged.

For a detailed list of artifact submission guidelines and resources, please see
the artifacts page on the PoPETs website:
https://petsymposium.org/artifacts.php. Note that the ARTIFACT_EVALUATION.md
file has been renamed to ARTIFACT-APPENDIX.md and has been modified. Ensure that
you use the latest version of the file, as described on the artifacts page
linked above.

You can also see submitted artifacts from the 2025 edition of PoPETs linked
along with the papers on the program https://petsymposium.org/2025/program.php
and proceedings website: https://petsymposium.org/popets/2025/

The deadline for artifact submissions for PETS 2026 issue 2 is:

**Wednesday, Dec 10, 2025 at 23:59 AoE**.

To submit your artifact, create an account on our artifact submission site for
2026.2:

> https://artifact.petsymposium.org/artifact2026.2/

The next deadlines are:

- Artifact Submission Deadline: Wednesday, Dec 10, 2025
- Evaluation and Interactive Discussion Start: Wednesday, Dec 17, 2025
- Preliminary Artifact Review Deadline: Wednesday, Jan 7, 2026
- Preliminary Artifact Authors Updates Deadline: Wednesday, Jan 14, 2026
- Evaluation and Interactive Discussion continue until decision is reached
- Artifact Finalized Deadline (firm): Friday, Feb 6, 2026

Note that the artifact review process is meant to be interactive between authors
and reviewers in order to fix potential issues that are uncovered during the
evaluation. To ensure this interactivity, within the deadlines, we have added a
date by which reviewers will be asked to submit a preliminary review, as well as
a date by which the authors will be expected to have responded and made
preliminary updates. Thus, please actively respond to reviewers' comments and
make modifications (if needed), so that your artifact can be awarded badge(s) by
the Artifact Finalized Deadline. For this issue of the artifact review, we 
have ensured that both the preliminary review deadline (Jan 7) and preliminary 
authors' update deadline (Jan 14) do not fall during the holiday break.

Please let us know at <artifact26@petsymposium.org> if you have any concerns
with meeting these deadlines, would like to submit to a later artifact issue,
or, have any questions regarding the process.

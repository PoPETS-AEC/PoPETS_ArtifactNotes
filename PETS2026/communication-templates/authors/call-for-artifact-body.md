PoPETs reviews and publishes digital artifacts related to its accepted papers.
This process aids in the reproducibility of results and allows others to build on the work described in the paper.
Artifact submissions are requested from authors of all accepted papers, and although they are optional, we strongly encourage you to submit your artifacts for review.

Artifacts can include source code for proofs of concept, measurements, user studies, course repositories, simulations, datasets, and build environments.
Anything you can think of that would help other researchers and developers of privacy enhancing technologies reproduce, build upon, or deploy your research is encouraged.

For a detailed list of artifact submission guidelines and resources, please see the artifacts page on the PoPETs website: https://petsymposium.org/artifacts.php.
Ensure that you use the latest version of the ARTIFACT-APPENDIX.md file, as described on the artifacts page linked above.

You can also see submitted artifacts from the 2025 edition of PoPETs linked along with the papers on the program https://petsymposium.org/2025/program.php and proceedings website: https://petsymposium.org/popets/2025/

The next deadlines are:

Note that the artifact review process is meant to be interactive between authors and reviewers in order to fix potential issues that are uncovered during the evaluation. To ensure this interactivity, within the deadlines, we have added a date by which reviewers will be asked to submit a preliminary review, as well as a date by which the authors will be expected to have responded and made preliminary updates.

Thus, please actively respond to reviewers' comments and make modifications (if needed), so that your artifact can be awarded badge(s) by the Artifact Finalized Deadline.

Please let us know at <artifact26@petsymposium.org> if you have any concerns with meeting these deadlines, would like to submit to a later artifact issue, or, have any questions regarding the process.

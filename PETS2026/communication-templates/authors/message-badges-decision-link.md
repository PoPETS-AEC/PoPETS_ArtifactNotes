Thank you both reviewers and authors for the suggestions and improvements to the artifact. The artifact is now awarded the following badge(s):

- Artifacts Available
- Artifacts Functional
- Artifacts Reproduced

We will use the following stable and permanent link: <LINK>

If authors wish us to use another link (it needs to be stable and permanent), please comment it here soon. Note also that the badges and artifact link will only be reflected next to the paper on the PoPETS website once we have sent these updates to the publicity chairs, this may take a little time (definitely contact us if in 1 month your badges and artifact link have not appeared online).

Thanks for your responsiveness and congrats on getting the badge(s): we really appreciate all the hard work it represents to contribute to open-science for our community!

Best regards,

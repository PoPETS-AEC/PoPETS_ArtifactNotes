Subject: Preliminary review or comments and authors updates

Content: Dear author(s),

Some preliminary reviews and/or comments have been posted by artifact reviewers on your submission.

If you have not already, take a look at the potential suggestions and communicate soon with reviewers on the edits and tentative timeline you may be planning to do or have already done, and answer the questions reviewers may have.

Feel free to also post a comment to reviewers or us, chairs, if more clarifications are needed or if you have a question about anything.

Finally, a few reviewers are still working on their initial assessment; their comments will be posted as they come.

The next deadlines are:

- Preliminary Artifact Authors Updates Deadline: Wednesday, Oct 8, 2025
- Evaluation and Interactive Discussion continue until decision is reached
- Artifact Finalized Deadline (firm): Friday, Oct 31, 2025

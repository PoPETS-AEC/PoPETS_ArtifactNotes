Subject: Conditional invitation to submit artifact for %TITLEHINT%

Dear author(s),

While a decision may not have been reached yet for your paper currently under
revisions, the PoPETs 2026 Artifact Evaluation Chairs would like to notify you
of the artifact process in case your paper gets accepted.

Indeed, the artifact submission deadline is scheduled only a few days after the
paper revision deadline. As such, authors of revise papers may wish to work
ahead of their paper decision on their corresponding artifact. Thus, we are
extending to you the following **conditional** invitation to submit an artifact
**if your paper is accepted** for PETS 2026 issue 1.

%TITLE% %URL%/paper/%NUMBER%

Subject: Finalizing discussions + decisions by Friday, May 1

---

Hello reviewers,

Thank you all for your service to the PoPETs 2026 Artifact Evaluation Committee. The finalized deadline for badges decision for 2026.3 artifacts is less than a week away (Friday, May 1st), and we need your help to make it!

In the past days, we (artifact chairs Miti and Yohan) have been posting comments tagging authors and reviewers on still undecided artifacts to help the evaluation, discussion, and updates move along.

As reviewer on one of these artifacts, we need you in the coming days to:
- keep engaging and following up with authors,
- check authors' updates and respond to their comments,
- update your review and scores *if the artifact now satisfy the badge requirements* (to signal us it is ready),
- and tag us (artifact chairs) where necessary.

In case you are waiting on authors to make some updates, please send a kind message reminding them of the edits you are expecting for each badge. Additionally, we just sent a notification of the incoming finalized deadline to authors of undecided artifacts, hopefully this will help too.

Thanks in advance for your help in this final stage!

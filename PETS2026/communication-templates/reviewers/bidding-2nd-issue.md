Subject: Instructions and bidding by Dec 15, 2025 for PETS Artifacts 2026.2
Dear %NAME%,

The second round of submissions are in and there are 29 submissions, we expect that almost every committee member will be assigned a review this cycle. Review load is balanced across all issues. If you have not already indicated your conflicts, please do so.

Please follow the instructions attached below to indicate preferences on which artifacts you would like to review. The deadline for preferences is **Monday, Dec 15, 2025**, after this we will be assigning reviews.

IMPORTANTLY: Please set a negative preference of -5 for any submission you cannot review due to missing resources. Note that we provide VMs with GPUs (contact artifact chairs for access to these VMs).

Specific instructions for bids:
-------------------------------

- Go to the "Review Preferences" page (note that you can sort by topics score):   https://artifact.petsymposium.org/artifact2026.2/reviewprefs.php

- Enter one of the following values as a bid (it’s useful for the chairs when bids have clear semantics):
   3     I want to review this artifact
   2     It's a good artifact for me
   1     It's an ok artifact for me
   0     Doesn't seem right for me (default)
   -1    I really shouldn't be reviewing this
   -5    I cannot review this due to missing resources
   -100  Conflict

- Please try to enter a +2/+3 bid for at least 5 artifacts for which you think you are well qualified. Note that during the evaluation you do not need to do a detailed review of any source code, we are mostly checking to make sure the artifacts compile, run, and have easy to follow setup instructions. See our review guidelines for more information: https://petsymposium.org/artifacts.php

- New this year: the topics used to sort artifacts by relevance have been modified to be more fine-grained. We hope this will facilitate bidding and help us identify earlier on potential missing resources by reviewers.

This bidding process worked well last year, but we cannot guarantee you your preferences. However, we hope this continues to benefit reviewers and authors. Please do not feel you need to spend time selecting your artifacts. But if something particularly interests you or if you think something is too far outside your expertise, this is your chance to indicate it.

Please don't hesitate to contact us with any questions or concerns at any stage of this process!

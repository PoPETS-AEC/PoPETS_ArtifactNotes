Subject: 2026.2 Artifacts Evaluation is done!

Dear {{NAME}},

Decisions have been completed for all artifacts submitted in the 2026.2 issue for evaluation, and updates for badges and artifact links have been sent to appear on the PETS website soon. This concludes the review process for these 2026.2 artifacts. Below are the results for artifacts from 2026.2:

- Total artifacts submitted: 29
- Total artifacts that obtained a badge: 29
- Available: 6
- Available, Functional: 8
- Available, Functional, Reproduced: 15

First, let us thank you all for your great work and responsiveness with authors!

Second, we will delete shortly all VMs and data that were created through the website (https://artifact.petsymposium.org/artifact2026.2/) for evaluation. You can help us with this cleanup by stopping and deleting yourself the machines you may have created.

Third, if you cannot participate in issue 2026.3 for artifacts (assignment on March 18, preliminary review expected by April 1, finalized deadline on May 1) and have not yet let us know, please do that now, so that we can plan ahead and invite more reviewers.

Fourth, if you could circulate the self-nomination form (https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/n9SuDiQ4zkSFj+clQ3KeyKfZJK-wYSt9DUS9usJtkkw/)to colleagues you know that are serious, motivated, and would be willing to serve on the PETS Artifact Evaluation Committee. This would be extremely helpful to all of us, as we predict an increase in submissions for the last 2 artifact cycles of 2026.

Finally, you now all have a small PETS artifact review break. The next artifact submission deadline is March 11. We will remind Artifact Evaluation Committee members shortly before then about the overall process for bidding, assignment, and reviewing expectations. You can also use the PETS artifact review calendar (https://petsymposium.org/files/PoPETS-Artifacts-2026.ics) to keep track of upcoming tasks and deadlines.

Thanks again for your hard work! We really appreciate your service and your contribution to open-science for our community!

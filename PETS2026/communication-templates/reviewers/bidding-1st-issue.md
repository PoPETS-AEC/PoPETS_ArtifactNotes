Subject: Instructions and bidding by Sep 15, 2025 for PETS artifacts 2026.1

Dear {{NAME}},

Welcome to the PoPETs 2026 artifact evaluation committee!
We have received {{NUMSUBMITTED}} submissions. With over 70 committee members, we expect each member will be assigned at most 1 review this issue. If you have not already indicated your conflicts, please do so.

Please verify that your affiliation information is correct in HotCRP ({{LINK}}/users.php/pc) and on the PETS webpage (https://petsymposium.org/cfp26.php). Let us know if there are any errors.

We have opened up bidding for committee members to indicate preferences on which artifacts they would like to review. The deadline for preferences is **Monday, Sep 15, 2025 AoE**. We will be assigning reviews after this time.

IMPORTANTLY: Please set a negative preference of -5 for any submission you cannot review due to missing resources. Note that we provide VMs with GPUs. Email artifact chairs for access to these VMs.

Instructions for bids:
-------------------------------

1. Use the link below to sign in to the site.
   > {{LINK}}

2. Go to the "Review Preferences" page:
  > {{LINK}}/reviewprefs.php

2. Sort by the "Topic Score" column on the right-hand side.

3. Enter one of the following values in the "Preference" column. This is your bid; it’s useful for the chairs when bids have clear semantics:
   3     I want to review this artifact
   2     It's a good artifact for me
   1     It's an ok artifact for me
   0     Doesn't seem right for me (default)
   -1    I really shouldn't be reviewing this
   -5    I cannot review this due to missing resources
   -100  Conflict

- Please try to enter a +2/+3 bid for at least 2 artifacts for which you think you are well qualified. Note that during the evaluation you do not need to do a detailed review of any source code, we are mostly checking to make sure the artifacts compile, run, and have easy to follow setup instructions. See our review guidelines for more information: https://petsymposium.org/artifacts.php

- New this year: the topics used to sort artifacts by relevance were modified to allow reviews to indicate resource availability. We hope this will facilitate bidding and help us identify missing resources earlier.

This bidding process worked well last year, but we cannot guarantee you your preferences. However, we hope this continues to benefit reviewers and authors. Please do not feel you need to spend time selecting your artifacts. But if something particularly interests you or if you think something is too far outside your expertise, this is your chance to
indicate it.

Please don't hesitate to contact us with any questions or concerns at any stage of this process!

Subject: Instructions and bidding by Sep 15, 2025 for PETS artifacts 2026.1

Dear %NAME%,

Welcome to the PoPETs 2026 artifact evaluation committee! The first issue of
submissions are in and there are <NUMBER> submissions.  With <NUMBER> committee
members we expect each member will be assigned <NUMBERS> reviews this issue. If
you have not already indicated your conflicts, please do so.

Further, please verify that your affiliation information is correct in HotCRP
(https://artifact.petsymposium.org/artifact2026.1/users.php/pc) and on the PETS
webpage (https://petsymposium.org/cfp26.php). Let us know if there are any
errors.

We have opened up bidding for committee members to indicate preferences on which
artifacts they would like to review. The deadline for preferences is **Monday,
Sep 15, 2025**, after this we will be assigning reviews.

IMPORTANTLY: Please set a negative preference of -5 for any submission you
cannot review due to missing resources. Note that we provide VMs with GPUs
(contact artifact chairs for access to these VMs).

Specific instructions for bids:
-------------------------------

Site URL: https://artifact.petsymposium.org/artifact2026.1

**Enter bids, you can sort by relevance**:
- Go to the "Review Preferences" page:
  https://artifact.petsymposium.org/artifact2026.1/reviewprefs.php

- Enter one of the following values as a bid (itâ€™s useful for the
chairs when bids have clear semantics):
   3     I want to review this artifact
   2     It's a good artifact for me
   1     It's an ok artifact for me
   0     Doesn't seem right for me (default)
   -1    I really shouldn't be reviewing this
   -5    I cannot review this due to missing resources
   -100  Conflict

- Please try to enter a +2/+3 bid for at least 2 artifacts for which you think
you are well qualified. Note that during the evaluation you do not need to do a
detailed review of any source code, we are mostly checking to make sure the
artifacts compile, run, and have easy to follow setup instructions. See our
review guidelines for more information: https://petsymposium.org/artifacts.php

- New this year: the topics used to sort artifacts by relevance have been
modified to be more fine-grained. We hope this will facilitate bidding and
help us identify earlier on potential missing resources by reviewers.

This bidding process worked well last year, but we cannot guarantee you
your preferences. However, we hope this continues to benefit reviewers
and authors. Please do not feel you need to spend time selecting your
artifacts. But if something particularly interests you or if you think
something is too far outside your expertise, this is your chance to
indicate it.

Please don't hesitate to contact us with any questions or concerns at
any stage of this process!

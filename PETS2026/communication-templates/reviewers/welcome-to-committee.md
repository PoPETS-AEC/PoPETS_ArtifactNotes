Subject: Welcome to the PoPETS 2026 Artifact Evaluation Committee!

The call for artifacts for the first PETS issue 2026.1 was sent out and the first submissions are already registered.

**Login** To log into the submission site you can use the following link:
 > https://artifact.petsymposium.org/artifact2026.1/

With this email we want to inform you about four things:

1. **Affiliation and Conflict Information**: Please verify and update if necessary your affiliation and conflict information on your HotCRP profile.

2. **Topic Interests**: Indicate the artifacts you would be able to evaluate through the topic interests on your HotCRP profile. The same information is asked from authors at submission time. This will help us to avoid assigning reviewers with no access to the required hardware.

3. **Schedule**: The deadlines for PETS issue 2026.1 are:

- Call for Artifacts (Chairs) Aug 15
- Submission Deadline (Authors) Sep 10
- Bidding Deadline (Reviewers) Sep 15

To help you track of PETS Artifact 2026 Program Committee tasks and key milestones, we have created a calendar file (.ics). You can download and import it into your calendar application, or add it directly as a new calendar using the following link:

1. **Changes**: You can find the updated information on the artifact evaluation process here: https://petsymposium.org/artifacts.php
The most important changes are the clarification of the requirements for each of the three badges (Available, Functional, and Reproduced), the release of examples and other resources for artifact packaging, and the introduction of preliminary review, updates, and finalized deadlines to emphasize on the interactivity of the artifact evaluation process.

If you have any question, feel free to email us at artifact26@petsymposium.org or ping us in a reviewer/administrator-only visible comment on your assigned artifact(s) (once assignments are done).

We are looking forward to working with you all on these artifact evaluations, thank you!

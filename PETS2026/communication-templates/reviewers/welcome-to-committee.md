Subject: Welcome to the PoPETS 2026 Artifact Evaluation Committee!

The call for artifacts for the first PETS issue 2026.1 was sent out and the
first submissions are already registered.

**Login** To log into the submission site you can use the following link:
  > https://artifact.petsymposium.org/artifact2026.1/

With this email we want to inform you about four things:

1. **Affiliation and Conflict Information**: Please verify and update if
necessary your affiliation and conflict information on your HotCRP profile.

2. **Topic Interests**: Indicate the artifacts you would be able to evaluate
through the topic interests on your HotCRP profile. The same information is
asked from authors at submission time. This will help us to avoid assigning
reviewers with no access to the required hardware.

3. **Schedule**: The deadlines for PETS issue 2026.1 are:

| What?                                          | Who?                | When?                     |

4. **Changes**: You can find the updated information on the artifact evaluation
process here: https://petsymposium.org/artifacts.php The most important changes
are the clarification of the requirements for each of the three badges
(Available, Functional, and Reproduced), the release of examples and other
resources for artifact packaging, and the introduction of preliminary review,
updates, and finalized deadlines to emphasize on the interactivity of the
artifact evaluation process.

If you have any question, feel free to email us at artifact26@petsymposium.org
or ping us in a reviewer/administrator-only visible comment on your assigned
artifact(s) (once assignments are done).

We are looking forward to working with you all on these artifact evaluations,
thank you!

Subject: 2026.1 Artifacts Evaluation is done!

Dear {{NAME}},

Decisions have been completed for all artifacts submitted in the 2026.1 issue for evaluation, and updates for badges and artifact links have been sent to appear on the PETS website soon. This concludes the review process for these 2026.1 artifacts.

First, let us thank you all for your great work and responsiveness with authors; we are very pleased by the many high-quality reviews and discussions that you have participated in!

Second, if you have not been assigned a review yet, do not worry: our intention is to balance the review load across the 4 artifact issues between all reviewers. So, you will most likely get an artifact assigned during 2026.2.

Third, if you cannot participate in issue 2026.2 for artifacts (assignment on Dec 17, preliminary review expected by Jan 7, finalized deadline on Feb 6) and have not yet let us know, please do that now, so that we can know if we need to invite more reviewers.

Fourth, you now all have a small PETS artifact review break. The next artifact submission deadline is Dec 10. We will remind Artifact Evaluation Committee members shortly before then about the overall process for bidding, assignment, and reviewing expectations. You can also use the PETS artifact review calendar (https://petsymposium.org/files/PoPETS-Artifacts-2026.ics) to keep track of upcoming tasks and deadlines.

Finally, below are the results for artifacts from 2026.1:

- Total artifacts submitted: 17
- Total artifacts that obtained a badge: 17
- Available: 7
- Available, Functional: 3
- Available, Functional, Reproduced: 7

Thanks again for your hard work! We really appreciate your service and your contribution to open-science for our community!

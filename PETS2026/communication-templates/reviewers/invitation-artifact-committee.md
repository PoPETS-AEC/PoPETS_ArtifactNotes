We invite you to be part of the PoPETs Artifact Evaluation Committee for the upcoming year 2026.

**Artifact Reviewer Description**: Most artifacts are source code or datasets. So, the reviewer's role often consists of accessing the code repository, attempting to execute the code base following the documentation, verify if it corresponds to the paper (reviewing the documentation), and check if requirements for badges applied for are met. In most cases, the overall evaluation takes a few minutes to a maximum of a couple human hours. If, however, the reviewer runs into issues; they spend a short time attempting to fix the artifacts. If the artifacts have multiple issues, they document them, describe their progress and what they tried to get them running. And then post it back for the authors, who attempt to address the problems. The authors then fix the documentation and the code, so that reviewer can try again. So unlike a paper, initial artifact review is shorter (in terms of time), but then there are multiple short bursts of time needed to finish the iterative process. If an artifact is going on too long (or other exception), sometimes the chairs get involved to steer over to complete shepherding it towards acceptance.

**2025 Stats**: Last year there was a total of 100 artifacts submitted across the four issues, with ≤4 reviews per committee member total, and with ~1 assigned review per committee member in each issue.

**Process**: As last year, there are four issues for PoPETS 2026. For each issue:
- Authors are expected to submit their artifact ~10 days after the [paper revision deadline](https://petsymposium.org/cfp26.php).
- This is followed by a short bidding period from reviewers.
- Assignments are then sent out and evaluation starts.
- 2 weeks after assignments, reviewers are asked to submit a preliminary review.
- 3 weeks after assignments, authors are expected to have responded and made  preliminary updates.
- This interactive process continues until the finalized deadline (~6 weeks after assignments).

**Call for Artifact and Resources**:The current details of the review process along with guides for authors and reviewers can be found [here](https://petsymposium.org/artifacts.php). Note that we have made changes for PoPETS 2026 to improve the page and clarify guidelines according to feedback and lessons learned from PoPETS 2025. We have also made modifications on HotCRP to facilitate bidding and better structure the reviews.

**Suggestions or Questions**: If you have more suggestions for smoothing out the evaluation process and reducing the workload of the reviewers further, let us know at artifact26@petsymposium.org. In case of questions feel free to reach out to us at any time.

**Actions**: Please reply to this email by **<TODO-CHANGE-DATE>** if you're willing to serve in the Artifact Evaluation Committee this upcoming year:
- If 'yes', please confirm your details:
  - First Name: 
  - Last Name: 
  - Email: 
  - Affiliation: 
- If you don't want to serve, a simple 'no' is very helpful for our planning.
- If you got this email after that date (vacation, etc.), please feel free to still reach out if you are willing to be on the artifact committee, and we will try to make it work.

We are also looking for new artifact evaluation committee members, feel free to fill out or share the PoPETs nomination [form](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/n9SuDiQ4zkSFj+clQ3KeyKfZJK-wYSt9DUS9usJtkkw/) with anyone you know who might be interested.


Thank you in advance for your time and your response!

Welcome to the PoPETs 2025 artifact committee!

The call for artifacts for this first round was send out and the first
submissions are already registered. With this mail we want to inform you
about three things:

1. **Affiliation Information**: Please verify that your affiliation
information is correct in HotCRP. Let us know if there are any errors.


2. **Schedule**: Unfortunately, we are behind the schedule for this
first round. The reason is that we had some longer discussions on the
changes for this year. The schedule is now planned as follows:

| What?                |          When?  |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| Call for Artifacts:  | Sept 4th 2024   |
| Submission Deadline: | Sept 27th 2024  |
| Bidding Deadline:    | Oct 4th 2024    |
| Review Deadline:     | Oct 30th 2024   |

3. **Changes**: You can find the updated information on the artifact
evaluation process here: https://petsymposium.org/artifacts.php . The
most important change is that we will use three badges (Available,
Functional, and Reproduced), that can all be achieved independently.
This setting aligns PETS with most artifact evaluation processes in
other privacy and security conferences. The author are asked to checkbox
the respective badges during the submission process. Also we ask the
author for specific hardware requirements of their submission. That way
we want to avoid assigning reviewers with no access to the required
hardware.

If you have any question, feel free to send us an email at

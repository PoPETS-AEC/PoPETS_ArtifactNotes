We invite you to be part of the PoPETs artifact evaluation committee for the upcoming year 2025. 

Last year there were a total of 69 artifacts submitted, with  â‰¤3 reviews per committee member, and with ~1 assigned review per committee member in each round.

We hope you'll join us in doing in the upcoming year.
The deadlines and review periods for the upcoming year are similar to last year's.

As last year, there are four issues for PoPETS 2025. 
For each issue, the bidding period for artifacts starts ~3 weeks after the author notification date, which can be found [here](https://petsymposium.org/cfp25.php). The review period will then start approximately one week after that and will last for three weeks. The details of the review process can be found [here](https://petsymposium.org/artifacts.php), Note that we will improve the page according to your feedback from this year. In particular, we will detail the requirements of the individual badges. Again we will use the two badges "available" and "reproduced" (maybe adding a third one). Also, we will stick to the template that should be provided in a [standardized form](https://petsymposium.org/files/template.md), which the authors fill in during the submission. If you have more suggestions for smoothing the process and reducing the workload of the reviewers further, let us know at artifact25@petsymposium.org.

Please reply to this email to let us know by

PoPETs reviews and publishes digital artifacts related to its accepted
papers. This process aids in the reproducibility of results and allows
others to build on the work described in the paper. Artifact submissions
are requested from authors of all accepted papers, and although they are
optional, we strongly encourage you to submit your artifacts for review.

You can see a sampling of submitted artifacts from the 2022 issue of
PoPETs linked along with the papers on the website:
https://petsymposium.org/2022/program.php

The deadline for artifact submissions this round is **August 29th**. Please reach out to us if you want to submit an artifact but have an issue.

Artifacts can include source code for
proofs of concept, measurements, simulations, datasets, and build
environments. Anything you can think of that would help other
researchers and developers of privacy enhancing technologies reproduce,
build upon, or deploy your research is encouraged.

For a detailed list of artifact submission guidelines, please see the
artifacts page on the PoPETs website: https://petsymposium.org/artifacts.php

To submit your artifact, create an account on our artifact submission
site for 2023.1: https://submit.petsymposium.org/artifact2023/

Please let us know at <artifact-pets@petsymposium.org>  if you have any
questions or concerns!

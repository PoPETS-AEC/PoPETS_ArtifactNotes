# FAQ

## If we continue to develop our code beyond the scope of the paper, which version of the code should we submit? 

There is some flexibility here. You can certainly submit a particular release & add a section in `README.md` to point out the more up-to-date Github repository. We can also accept the Github repository as the submission; in this case, it would be great to clearly point to the version that is consistent to the paper (in case future developments make it inconsistent).

## Do we need VMs or Containers in our submission?

Although we strongly encourage VMs / containers, we understand that this is not possible in all cases and we do accept submissions without them. As long as the instructions are clear (e.g. the reviewers have no problem running the code), it should be fine.

# FAQ

## If we continue to develop our code beyond the scope of the paper, which version of the code we should submit? 

There is some flexibility here. You can certainly submit a particular release & add a section in README to point out the more up-to-date github repo. We can also accept the github repo as the submission; in this case, it would be great to clearly point to the version that is consistent to the paper (in case future developments make it inconsistent).

## Do we need VMs or Containers in our submission?

Although we strongly encourage VMs / containers, we understand that this is not possible in all cases and we do accept submissions without them. I have not looked at your repos closely but the instructions seem sufficiently clear; as long as this is the case (and e.g. the reviewers have no problem running the code), it should be fine.
